    <h1>The History of Mark Zuckerberg</h1>
    <img src="assets/mark_zuckerberg.jpg" alt="The CEO of two large companies">
    <p>Mark Zuckerberg is an american business man born May 14, 1984. He co-founded companies such as Facebook, now known as Meta, which he is the chairman of. He spent a small amount of time at harvard before his launch of facebook in 2004
        His company meta was responsible for one of the greatest creations known to man, the oculus. This virtual reality headset 
        is extremely fun to use and doesn't require the wires that other vr headsets need. Mark learned computer programming very early on, 
        At about the age of eleven, when he created a program called Zucknet that allowed computers at the family home and his father's 
        dental office to communicate with each other.</p>
